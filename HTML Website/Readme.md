At the start of this project I wanted to recreate the feel of popular movie review sites, while still keeping the code simple enough to understand and maintain. My low-fidelity prototypes helped me map out the main user journey: landing on a home page with a slideshow of featured movies, browsing lines of “Popular” and “Trending” titles, and then clicking a movie to open a dedicated page with the detailed information of both the cast and the user reviews. Having those sketches meant I always had a clear visual target and avoided getting lost in small styling decisions too early.
As I moved from the sketches to the final site, a lot of decisions were about balancing “looking like IMDb/Rotten Tomatoes” with what I could realistically implement. For example, the original wireframes showed slideshow arrows and multiple content rows; in the build I implemented a hero slider that rotates through selected movies, plus horizontal scrollable rows for different categories. On the content page, I kept the large poster, description, score bar, and cast strip exactly as drawn, but I simplified some elements (e.g., using a bar + dot instead of a complex rating graph). The biggest functional step beyond the sketch was adding localStorage so reviews and ratings are saved between page loads, which makes the site feel more like a real application.
Some things worked well, especially the modular movie data structure. By keeping all movie information (title, year, genre, cast, poster URLs) in JavaScript objects, I could reuse it across both pages and generate cards, details, and related-movie sections dynamically. The main challenge was keeping navigation and state consistent across two separate HTML pages while still sharing data. I solved this by passing the movie ID in the query string and rebuilding the page from that ID on the content page.
If I repeated the project, I would improve accessibility (keyboard controls for the slideshow, clearer focus styles) and possibly refactor to a single-page app structure, which would make transitions smoother and easier to extend. I would also like to connect the review system to a real backend instead of localStorage, so different users could see the same ratings and possibly create the website with more illustration and color, as the simple color palette looked dull and reminded more of IMDb; which I was used as one of the inspirations to form this website.
